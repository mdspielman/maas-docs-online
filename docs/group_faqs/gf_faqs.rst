The differences between On Demand and Prepaid Subscription plans are well described here:
`Concept On-Demand vs Prepaid Subscription <https://cloud.solace.com/learn/group_concepts>`_

You could use a mix of both On Demand and Prepaid subscriptions in your account. Most customers will choose Prepaid plans for applications with predictable usage,
and use on-demand to cover any overages, for new applications or for those applications with variable usage.

Prepaid Subscriptions provide you a discount in return for a longer-term commitment and help you minimize your invoicing overhead.

Why aren't all of the regions listed on the `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_ available when I'm creating a service?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Only certain regions are available when creating a Free service.  Free service regions are marked with an asterisk on our `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_. Even if you're not using a Free service, you may notice that some regions are not available. This is because we list all of the "Available" regions on our website, while only the "Enabled" regions can be used when creating a service.

"Available" regions are those which have been identified as having the IaaS resources that are required to run our messaging services. "Enabled" regions are those in which PubSub+ Cloud infrastructure is installed and ready to create messaging services.

Can I request a region listed on the `pricing page <https://cloud.solace.com/pricing/>`_ to be available when I'm creating a service?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, we add regions to PubSub+ Cloud based on customer demand and you can request a region from our Create Service screen.

* Click the "Request a region" link under the map
