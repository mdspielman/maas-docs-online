An Introduction to Messaging
============================

In development terms, **Messaging** refers to the set of concepts that lets computer systems, applications or services share
information without requiring coupling [1]_ or awareness of one another's location.

So what are the core concepts that you need to know:

- **Publisher**: the entity that sends or publishes the **Message** - Also called **Producer**
- **Message** or **Event**: what the **Publisher** wants to say to the **Subscriber**
- **Subscriber**: the ultimate receiver of the **Message** or **Event** - Also called **Consumer**

In addition:

- A **Message** typically has a destination that decouples the **Publisher** from the **Subscriber**
- A destination can be a **Topic** or a **Queue**:
    - **Topic** when the **Message** is intended to be consumed by more than one **Subscribers**
    - **Queue** when the **Message** is intended to be consumed by at most one **Subscriber**

.. [1] The idea is that we should try to keep the coupling between classes in our systems as 'loose' as possible:
    hence 'loose coupling' or sometimes 'decoupling' (although in English 'decoupling' would mean 'no coupling at all',
    people often use it to imply 'loose coupling' between entities)
